  		<h1>Nursing Home Resident to Resident Aggression - A Disturbing and Continuing Problem in the U.S.</h1>
  		<h2>By: Cindy Marchionda</h2>
		<h3>November 23, 2024</h3>

		<p>
			The U.S. population is older today than it's ever been, according to the Population Reference Bureau.  The U.S. Census Bureau said that by 2050, the total number of adults ages 65 and older will rise to 85.7 million people, or roughly 20% of the overall U.S. population. Where will all of these people go for end of life care?  Most likely, nursing homes and assisted living facilities. 

		</p>

		<p>
			Nursing homes should provide quality care to keep our loved ones safe.  When families, especially spouses or children, place their loved one in a nursing home, it’s almost always a last resort. This decision usually comes after realizing the family can’t provide the necessary care themselves. The mother or father can’t walk, dress, bathe, etc.  It’s an excruciating decision that requires careful handling from everyone involved.

		</p>

		<p>
			You would expect that when a family pays six to eight thousand dollars a month to a nursing home, the quality of care would be at the very least,  decent: ensuring their loved one’s safety. Making sure to keep them fed, clean, and treated with dignity.

			<h2>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) is allegedly underrporting resident-to-resident aggression on nursing home inspection reports.</h2>

			
			<p>
				 NYCity News Service reviewed over 100 CMS nursing home inspection reports and found that surveyors discovered injuries and even deaths stemming from resident-on-resident violence. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11069077/"> The National Institutes of Health </a> (NIH) reported in May 2024, that resident to resident aggression is highly prevalent, at a rate of apprxomiately 20 percent.  

				 There is still speculation as to whether the fault lies in the failure of the nursing homes not taking proper measures that could prevent the violence altogether.

			<h2>Uninspected and Neglected</h2>
			<p>
				The U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, did an investigation on nursing homes in 2023 called <a href="https://www.aging.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/UNINSPECTED%20&%20NEGLECTED%20-%20FINAL%20REPORT.pdf"> The Senate Aging Report </a> </figcaption>. They found that inspection agencies are severley understaffed - putting residents at risk. 
			
				Nearly a third of the Nation’s 15,000 nursing homes are behind on comprehensive annual inspections, including one in nine that have not received an annual inspection in two years or more. Annual inspections are infrequent and familes have filed more complaints. Abuse, neglect and serious health deficiencies were reported.  
			</p>
	  
			<p>
				As expressed by Robert Casey, Jr., Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, "This investigation should serve as wakeup call. It is past time that we come together to adequately fund long-term care and ensure there is a capable regulatory system to oversee it."
			</p>

			<h2>Nursing homes are understaffed - employees are underpaid, overworked and undereducated in dementia care.</h2>
			
			<p>
				Eilon Caspi is a gerontologist and a <a href="https://dementiabehaviorconsulting.com//"> dementia behavior specialist,</a> </figcaption> trainer/educator, researcher, writer, care advocate, and elders’ human rights activist.  His goal is to improve the quality of care and safety of people living with dementia in nursing homes and assisted living facilities.
			</p>

			<p> 
				Caspi is passionate about this ongoing problem.  He calls it resident to resident incidents (instead of using the word aggression).

			</p>
			<p> 

			 	"The root causes are inadequate care, lack of staffing, and poor training rather than the residents' behavior. We need to shift the narrative away from blaming individuals with dementia and towards addressing organizational failures," says Caspi.
